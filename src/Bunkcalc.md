## Week count
for 
(17 weeks in total)-(1 week for midsem)-(3 week for endsem)-(1 week for public holdays)= 12 weeks
we consider one bunk count less for safety
## Lab ??
Kopala and Emmy mam marked only 2 points for his lab, counting the 2 hours of lab to be just one hour as any normal class

But, in the course credit calc lab only has 1 hour contribution so the total credit count is actually the total attendencable hours in a week for a course.
